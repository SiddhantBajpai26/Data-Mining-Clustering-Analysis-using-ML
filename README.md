Data mining clustering analysis: Used k-means, DB-SCAN algorithms to uncover patterns from data set for Market Segmentation.

What is Clustering?
Using the data mining method of clustering, similar objects are grouped together based on a variety of factors, 
including proximity, density, graphs, and statistical distributions. Numerous disciplines, including unsupervised 
machine learning, data mining, statistics, graph analytics and image processing can benefit from the use of this 
technique. By grouping data points into clusters, it is possible to make items within a cluster more like one another 
than those in other clusters. To analyse and interpret complicated data, clustering is a potent tool for finding patterns, 
relationships, and structures in big datasets (Sehgal, 2022)

## Conclusion
In conclusion to the algorithms used (Kmeans, DBSCAN and Agglomerative) to perform efficient clustering on the given dataset, all three algorithms were able to locate distinct clusters in the data, but there were differences in the number of clusters found, how outliers were handled, whether the number of clusters needed 
to be pre-specified, whether complex cluster shapes or structures could be captured, and how local data point densities were taken into account. In general, the specific qualities of the dataset and the goals of the research will determine which clustering algorithm is best suited.
